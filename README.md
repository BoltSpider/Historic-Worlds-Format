Rules are simple, matches are Best of 3 This format will have a custom ban list as time goes on and will update every banlist Cards have their Pre-Errata Effect even if they are forbidden. Some cards cannot be summoned properly or use their effects so they are blank cards for the time being and can be played. Past changes will be kept track of. Even decks that do top will be placed in this document as well. You can find me on Twitch(Bolt_Spider) and Youtube BoltSpider

This is made for fun and Tournaments as well so I hope you all enjoy. If you use this for a tournament please credit me as the creator.
